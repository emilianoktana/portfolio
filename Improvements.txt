IMPROVEMENTS 

- Remove underline from text input when run on Android
    This was fixed by using underlineColorAndroid prop on the TextInput component

- Added eslint configuration

- Added points to the font size of pie chart labels, also has to cut the label text to render the chart centered on the wrapper

- Added a validation, when the user doesn't complete all the inputs, any action is triggered until all the inputs are filled.
    This was fixed on the InvestmentsScreen, validating with the totalAmount variable, when it's -1 some of the inputs isn't complete.

- Added some improvements to the UI

- Added validation to InvestmentsScreen, when there is a non-numeric value on on the inputs, the calculate action will not trigger until inputs has numeric values.
    This was fixed by using a regular expression everytime the user modifies an input. When there is a text value, I don't set the state.
